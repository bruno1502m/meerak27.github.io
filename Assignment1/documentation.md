# Project Name: 30MFF Film Web Page

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and engaging web page to house and debut a short film. The web page was designed to showcase the film while providing information about the story, title, tagline, font colors, reviews, bios for the actors, and behind the scenes photos. The final site with embedded video was uploaded and made live on GitHub pages. The web page included a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file, and at least one element of "interactivity" was incorporated into the page.

## Process
To implement the concept, I started by brainstorming the branding elements that would be used for the film, including the font, colors, and tagline. Then, I created a wireframe for the web page layout and thought of what experience I want the user to have. Once the design was finalized, I built the web page using HTML and CSS, incorporating the branding elements and ensuring that the web page was responsive and easy to navigate. I also added JavaScript to create interactivity on the page, such as a hover effect for the navigation links and a pop-up modal for the embedded video. However, I had a mishap with my computer today where water spilled inside my bag, and it certainly caused a setback. I had to redo this and since I didn’t have enough time, I used a template.

I think this was somehow a blessing in disguise. When I first started this project, I had very minimal experience with CSS and HTML. To be honest, I was quite intimidated by the task at hand. I had some basic understanding of the concepts, but I had never actually built a great web page from scratch before. I was worried that I would not be able to understand the requirements and produce a web page that met the project standards. However, the instructional videos and resources available online helped me gain a better understanding of the basics of CSS and HTML, and I was able to gradually build up my skills and confidence throughout the project. Although I still have a lot to learn, I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and improve my skills in web development.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the number of templates available on Nicepage, which allowed me to find a design that was both suitable for the project and visually appealing. Being able to use a template gave me a similar sense of working in the real world, where there are often pre-existing designs and styles to work with. Shortcuts are allowed in the real world as long as you do them legally. And I'm happy that I was allowed to use templates in this project, as it not only helped me submit in time but also allowed me to produce a high-quality web page.

I’m mainly happy with the photo carousel and how I stayed true to my original idea. I found myself constantly editing the wireframe and making decisions that were not in the original plan. This goes to show that the wireframe isn’t the end of the layout process it’s just the start. It was also really helpful because it helped me visualize and imagine the elements without coding then changing my mind. 

I wanted to go for a very aesthetic, neutral and calming website and to me I think I have achieved that. 

## Reflection/Evaluation
Overall, I am pleased with how the project turned out. The final working version of the web page successfully showcased the film in a visually engaging way, and I was able to incorporate all the necessary branding elements and information about the film. The interactivity elements added a nice touch and made the page more engaging for the user. However, there were some challenges along the way, such as ensuring that the web
