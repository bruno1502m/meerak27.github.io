      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="1000" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic">Once
        upon a time, there was a young boy who loved exploring the forest. One day, while wandering through the
        woods, he spotted a beautiful, juicy-looking apple hanging from a tree. The apple looked so delicious that he
        couldn't resist reaching up to grab it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page page_3">
      <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="2800" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic"> As he
        was about to take a bite, a wise old owl sitting on a nearby branch warned him, "That apple may look
        delicious, but it's actually poisoned.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page page_4">
      <p data-aos="fade-down-left" data-aos-delay="2800" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic">
        The boy hesitated for a moment, but his hunger got the best of him, and he decided to ignore the owl's warning.
        He took a bite of the apple anyway.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page page_5">
      <p data-aos="fade-down-right" data-aos-delay="2800" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic">
        Immediately, he felt sick and dizzy, and regret flooded over him as he realized too late that the owl was
        right. He fell to the ground, feeling the effects of the poison coursing through his body.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page page_6">
      <p zoom-in data-aos-delay="2800" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic">The boy hung his
        head in shame, knowing that he should have listened to the owl's warning. From that day
        forward, he vowed to always consider the advice of others and think through his actions before making a
        decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page page_7">
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="2800" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic">As he
        sat there, feeling miserable, the wise old owl flew down and landed next to him. "Remember this, young
        one," said the owl. "Sometimes things may seem appealing at first, but it's important to listen to warnings and
        think before acting."</p>

      <h2 data-aos="fade-down-left" data-aos-delay="2800" data-aos-duration="3000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-cubic">
        As he trudged home, feeling ill and sorry for himself, the boy realized that he had learned an important
        lesson that day. He had learned that sometimes the easy choice isn't always the best one, and that it's always
        wise to consider the advice of others and think things through before making a decision.</h2>
